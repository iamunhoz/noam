## Main Purpose
Noam is a Simplified Syntax Tree Generator. It is named after a famous proponent linguist of this theory, Noam Chomsky. And it is called _Simplified_ because there is a lot more to be said about Syntax Trees than what it is included in this software. If your goal is to use a comprehensive tool for academic research, The author of this software advises you to opt for the excelent [TreeForm]() or look for [LateX Solutions]().
:warning:

It was chosen to be <em>Simplified</em> in a effort to make it an <b>introductory educational tool</b> for this theory. The author had in mind not linguists doing their work, but teachers that would like to use <em>Syntax Trees</em> in their children or teenager classrooms.</div>
