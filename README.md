## Main Purpose
Noam is a Simplified Syntax Tree Generator. It is named after a famous proponent linguist of this theory, Noam Chomsky. And it is called _Simplified_ because there is a lot more to be said about Syntax Trees than what it is included in this software. If your goal is to use a comprehensive tool for academic research, The author of this software advises you to opt for the excelent [TreeForm]() or look for [LateX Solutions]().

It was chosen to be _Simplified_ in a effort to make it an __introductory educational tool__ for this theory. The author had in mind not linguists doing their work, but teachers that would like to use Syntax Trees in their children or teenager classrooms.

## Definition of a Syntax Tree
According to [this]() article of the site GeeksforGeeks:
>A Syntax tree or a parse tree is a tree representation of different syntactic categories of a sentence. It helps us to understand the syntactical structure of a sentence.

And a graphical example, taken from the article above:
