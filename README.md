# Noam - a syntax-tree builder

## About
A Syntax tree or a parse tree is a tree representation of different syntactic categories of a sentence. It helps us to understand the syntactical structure of a sentence.

The goal of this app is to provide a gamified experience with the creation of syntax trees, for the sake of making it easier to teach generative grammar to teenagers.

## Running

Live server the index.html file.

## Next steps

- Implement Three.js graphics to make the app look more like a game.
